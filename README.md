# Java Interface Pop-up Agenda Planner

This project is designed to help students learn Java by implementing an interface pop-up agenda planner. The planner allows users to add participants, display participant names and times, and perform input validation for warnings. The interface resembles the provided image and provides a clean and user-friendly experience.

## Learning Objectives

By working on this project, you will not only gain practical experience in Java programming but also develop essential skills for real-life project development. The project follows a different approach compared to the guided projects on Hyperskill. Instead of step-by-step instructions, you will be given the requirements and an expected GUI. It will be your responsibility to determine how to implement the functionalities and design the code. This approach encourages creative thinking and simulates real-life project scenarios.

Alongside this mini-project, you will continue with the Hyperskill course, allowing you to practice time management and efficient scheduling. The way you schedule and organize your project will be an essential aspect, and it should be documented in the README file.

## Project Organization

To efficiently manage and complete this project, it is crucial to plan and schedule your tasks. Here's an example of how you can organize your project:

1. **Requirement Analysis**: Read and understand the provided requirements. Identify the core functionalities needed for the agenda planner.

2. **GUI Design**: Create a plan for the graphical user interface (GUI) based on the provided expected design. Determine the placement of elements, color scheme, and overall aesthetics. Consider using IntelliJ IDEA's form builder to design the GUI quickly.

3. **Code Structure**: Divide your code into classes based on the logical separation of responsibilities. Identify the classes needed to implement the functionalities, such as the main application class, participant management class, and database integration class.

4. **Implementation**: Start implementing the core functionalities one by one. Begin with the basic features, such as adding participants and displaying their names and times in the dark green part of the interface.

5. **Input Validation**: Implement the input validation mechanism to check for incorrect inputs and display warnings accordingly.

6. **Testing**: Test each functionality thoroughly to ensure it works as expected. Validate the input validation and warning mechanisms. Use different scenarios to verify the correctness and robustness of your implementation.

7. **Documentation**: Write clear comments for classes, methods, and functions, following best practices for documentation. Update the README file with detailed instructions on how to set up and run the project. Include any additional information that would be helpful for others to understand and use your application.

8. **Version Control**: Regularly commit your code changes to the GitHub repository. Make it a habit to commit and push your work at least once per day to showcase your progress. This practice will allow tech coaches to track your activity on GitHub.

9. **Continued Learning**: As you work on the project, continue following the Hyperskill course materials. Use the project as an opportunity to apply the concepts and techniques you learn along the way.
